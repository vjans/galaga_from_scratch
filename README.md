# Galaga Clone

## Project Overview
This project is a clone of the classic arcade game Galaga, inspired by Edgar M. Vigdal's "Warblade." It's an endeavor to create a full-featured game entirely from scratch using pure C++ and legacy OpenGL. The focus is on developing maintainable and extensible code, addressing the common challenge of codebases becoming unwieldy over time.

### Current State
The game is currently in the early stages of development. It includes basic gameplay mechanics where players control a spaceship to shoot enemies. The roadmap includes implementing various game states, adding levels, and introducing a shop feature for in-game upgrades.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (C++98 compatible)
- OpenGL (legacy version)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure all required software and libraries are installed.
3. Compile the source files. Adjust the makefile or compilation commands based on your setup.
4. Run the compiled executable to start the game.

## Usage
**Controls:**
*Instructions on game controls – moving the spaceship, shooting, etc.*

**Playing the Game:**
*Brief instructions on game objectives and gameplay mechanics.*
